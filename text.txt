Hello! I'm Max. I'm from the United states. And you? Where are you from?
Hey brother! People call me Carlos and I'm from Talum, Mexico. Do you know where that is?
Unfortunaty, I don't know where it is (awkward face). But I can tell you how much money I have right now!
How is that even relevant? Ahhhh... I see now, you would want me to sell you my phone. You've been looking at it since you saw me!
Exactly! I have 2.5 billion dollars in my visa card now!
Fuck! This is just a $1000 phone brother! You didn't have to say that at all!
I'll come back to your house tomorrow to get it. Okay?
No problem! Nice metting you "Rich Guy"!
Don't fuckin' call me that! Bye!
Goodbye!
Wait! Don't go yet
What is it? Are you okay?
Oh my god! Man!
What? What the fuck! Jesus fucking Christ!
The time! You forgot! at 2p.m.. Here in the U.S.A.!
